<h1 id="header">WaterSlide multiplexing demonstration</h1>

<p>You might have been pointed here by someone for a demonstration of the
multiplexing feature of the WaterSlide presentation program.</p>

<p>Below these paragraphs, you'll find two so called "iframes". These "inline frames"
are used to embed another webpage into another. You might recognise these as the
technology used to show advertisements, or the way Youtube embeds video's into
webpages.</p>

<p>These Iframes (in this case) represent two devices. One of these could be a
laptop hooked up to a beamer. The other one could be your smartphone. You could
then use said smartphone to walk around and present, and letting the laptop take
care of the beamer. You could also use the laptop for keyboard control, when
necessary</p>

<p>Both of these Iframes are set up to be so called "masters" of the
presentation. If you go to the next slide (arrow keys, or swipes) in one
presentation, the other one will follow. There is also a slave option, which
will cause the slide configured as a slave to follow the master presentation.</p>
