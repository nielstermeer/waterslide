# List of currently available providers:

# - github	(points to raw.githubusercontent, hakimel's repository at master)
# - local	(Depends on the fact that a Reveal.js repository should be
#		 available under /reveal.js/ on the same hostname. It does not
#		 matter if it is served through this application or another
#		 webserver which acts as a frontend.
#
#		 It might be necessary to supress an error message if
#		 one uses the latter scenario. see "waterslide serve -h" for
#		 for more information (tl;dr: use "--no-local-route"))
